# Simple KaTeX preview generator
When i studied at school and we used our school laptops to do some exercises online, I had to use KaTeX generator on a strange website. Now I made my own KaTeX generator.

It is very simple to use and it is very minimalistic: link to KaTeX docs, theme button, input field and generated output. Hope it helped someone. License: [WTFPL 2](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)
